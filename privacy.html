            <h2 id="mOverview">Overview of Processing Activities</h2><p>The following summary outlines the types of data processed, the purposes of their processing, and refers to the data subjects.</p><h3>Types of Data Processed</h3>
            <ul><li>Inventory data.</li><li>Employee data.</li><li>Contact data.</li><li>Content data.</li><li>Usage data.</li><li>Meta, communication, and procedural data.</li><li>Log data.</li></ul><h3>Categories of Data Subjects</h3><ul><li>Employees.</li><li>Communication partners.</li><li>Users.</li><li>Third parties.</li><li>Whistleblowers.</li></ul><h3>Purposes of Processing</h3><ul><li>Communication.</li><li>Security measures.</li><li>Organizational and administrative procedures.</li><li>Feedback.</li><li>Provision of our online offering and user-friendliness.</li><li>Information technology infrastructure.</li><li>Whistleblower protection.</li></ul><h2 id="m2427">Applicable Legal Bases</h2><p><strong>Applicable legal bases according to the GDPR: </strong>Below you will find an overview of the legal bases of the GDPR on which we process personal data. Please note that in addition to the regulations of the GDPR, national data protection regulations may apply in your or our country of residence or registered office. If more specific legal bases are relevant in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the privacy policy.</p>
             <ul><li><strong>Consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR)</strong> - The data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes.</li><li><strong>Performance of a contract and pre-contractual inquiries (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR)</strong> - Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.</li><li><strong>Legal obligation (Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR)</strong> - Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject.</li><li><strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR)</strong> - Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.</li></ul><p><strong>National data protection regulations in Austria: </strong>In addition to the data protection regulations of the GDPR, national data protection regulations apply in Austria. This includes, in particular, the Federal Act concerning the Protection of Personal Data (Datenschutzgesetz – DSG). The DSG contains special provisions on the right to information, the right to rectification or erasure, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes, and transfer, as well as automated individual decision-making.</p>
            <p><strong>Note on the applicability of GDPR and Swiss DPA: </strong>This privacy notice serves to provide information under both the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (DPA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For this reason, please note that the terms of the GDPR are used for broader spatial application and comprehensibility. In particular, instead of the terms "processing" of "personal data," "overriding interest," and "special categories of personal data" used in the Swiss DPA, the terms "processing" of "personal data," "legitimate interest," and "special categories of data" used in the GDPR are employed. However, the legal meaning of the terms will continue to be determined by the Swiss DPA within its scope of application.</p>
            <p><strong>Applicability of data protection regulations in the country of domicile: </strong>In the country where the controller is domiciled, national data protection regulations apply in addition to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
            
            <h2 id="m27">Security Measures</h2><p>We take appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with legal requirements, considering the state of the art, implementation costs, and the nature, scope, circumstances, and purposes of the processing, as well as the varying likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.</p>
            <p>These measures include, in particular, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data, as well as access, input, disclosure, availability, and separation of the data. Furthermore, we have established procedures to ensure the exercise of data subjects' rights, the deletion of data, and responses to data breaches. We also consider the protection of personal data during the development or selection of hardware, software, and procedures, in accordance with the principle of data protection by design and by default.</p>
            <p>Securing online connections with TLS/SSL encryption technology (HTTPS): To protect user data transmitted via our online services from unauthorized access, we use TLS/SSL encryption technology. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are the cornerstones of secure data transmission on the internet. These technologies encrypt the information transmitted between the website or app and the user's browser (or between two servers), thereby protecting the data from unauthorized access. TLS, as the more advanced and secure version of SSL, ensures that all data transmissions meet the highest security standards. When a website is secured by an SSL/TLS certificate, this is indicated by the display of HTTPS in the URL. This serves as an indicator to users that their data is being transmitted securely and encrypted.</p>
            
            <h2 id="m24">International Data Transfers</h2><p>Data processing in third countries: If we transfer data to a third country (i.e., outside the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA)) or if this occurs in the context of using third-party services or disclosing/transferring data to other persons, entities, or companies (which becomes apparent from the postal address of the respective provider or if explicitly mentioned in the privacy policy), this is always done in compliance with legal requirements.</p>
            <p>For data transfers to the USA, we primarily rely on the Data Privacy Framework (DPF), which was recognized as a secure legal framework by an adequacy decision of the EU Commission on July 10, 2023. Additionally, we have concluded Standard Contractual Clauses with the respective providers, which comply with the requirements of the EU Commission and establish contractual obligations to protect your data.</p>
            <p>This dual protection ensures comprehensive security for your data: The DPF forms the primary level of protection, while the Standard Contractual Clauses serve as additional security. Should there be any changes to the DPF, the Standard Contractual Clauses will act as a reliable fallback option. This way, we ensure that your data remains adequately protected even in the event of any political or legal changes.</p>
            <p>For individual service providers, we will inform you whether they are certified under the DPF and whether Standard Contractual Clauses are in place. Further information on the DPF and a list of certified companies can be found on the website of the U.S. Department of Commerce at <a href="https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/" target="_blank">https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/</a>.</p>
            <p>For data transfers to other third countries, corresponding security measures apply, in particular Standard Contractual Clauses, explicit consent, or legally required transfers. Information on third-country transfers and applicable adequacy decisions can be found in the information provided by the EU Commission: <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en?prefLang=en" target="_blank">https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en?prefLang=en.</a></p>
            
            <h2 id="m12">General Information on Data Storage and Deletion</h2><p>We delete personal data that we process in accordance with legal provisions as soon as the underlying consents are revoked or no other legal bases for processing exist. This applies to cases where the original purpose of processing ceases to exist or the data is no longer required. Exceptions to this rule exist if legal obligations or special interests require longer retention or archiving of the data.</p>
            <p>In particular, data that must be retained for commercial or tax law reasons or whose storage is necessary for legal prosecution or to protect the rights of other natural or legal persons must be archived accordingly.</p>
            <p>Our privacy notices contain additional information on the retention and deletion of data that apply specifically to certain processing activities.</p>
            <p>If multiple retention periods or deletion deadlines are specified for a piece of data, the longest period always applies. Data that is no longer kept for its originally intended purpose but is retained for legal or other reasons will be processed exclusively for the reasons that justify its retention.</p>
            <p>Start of the period at the end of the year: If a period does not explicitly start on a specific date and is at least one year, it automatically begins at the end of the calendar year in which the event triggering the period occurred. In the case of ongoing contractual relationships under which data is stored, the triggering event is the date on which the termination or other conclusion of the legal relationship becomes effective.</p>
            
            <h2 id="m10">Rights of Data Subjects</h2><p>Rights of data subjects under the GDPR: As a data subject, you have various rights under the GDPR, which arise in particular from Articles 15 to 21 GDPR:</p><ul><li><strong>Right to object: You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to processing of personal data concerning you which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) GDPR, including profiling based on those provisions. Where personal data concerning you are processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data concerning you for such marketing, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.</strong></li><li><strong>Right to withdraw consent:</strong> You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.</li><li><strong>Right of access:</strong> You have the right to obtain confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning you are being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the personal data and further information and a copy of the data in accordance with legal requirements.</li><li><strong>Right to rectification:</strong> You have the right, in accordance with legal requirements, to obtain the completion of the data concerning you or the rectification of inaccurate data concerning you.</li><li><strong>Right to erasure and restriction of processing:</strong> You have the right, in accordance with legal requirements, to demand that data concerning you be erased without delay, or alternatively, to demand a restriction of the processing of the data in accordance with legal requirements.</li><li><strong>Right to data portability:</strong> You have the right to receive the data concerning you, which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format in accordance with legal requirements, or to request its transmission to another controller.</li><li><strong>Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority:</strong> Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of your habitual residence, place of work or place of the alleged infringement if you consider that the processing of personal data relating to you infringes the GDPR.</li></ul>
            
            <h2 id="m225">Provision of the Online Offering and Web Hosting</h2><p>We process users' data to be able to provide them with our online services. For this purpose, we process the user's IP address, which is necessary to transmit the content and functions of our online services to the user's browser or end device.</p>
            <ul class="m-elements"><li><strong>Types of data processed:</strong> Usage data (e.g., page views and dwell time, click paths, usage intensity and frequency, device types and operating systems used, interactions with content and functions); Meta, communication, and procedural data (e.g., IP addresses, timestamps, identification numbers, involved persons). Log data (e.g., log files concerning logins or data retrieval or access times.).</li><li><strong>Data subjects:</strong> Users (e.g., website visitors, users of online services).</li><li><strong>Purposes of processing:</strong> Provision of our online offering and user-friendliness; Information technology infrastructure (operation and provision of information systems and technical devices (computers, servers, etc.)). Security measures.</li><li><strong>Retention and deletion:</strong> Deletion according to the information in the section "General Information on Data Storage and Deletion".</li><li class=""><strong>Legal bases:</strong> Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR).</li></ul><p><strong>Further information on processing processes, procedures, and services:</strong></p><ul class="m-elements"><li><strong>Provision of online offering on rented storage space: </strong>For the provision of our online offering, we use storage space, computing capacity, and software that we rent or otherwise obtain from a corresponding server provider (also called "web hoster"); <span class=""><strong>Legal bases:</strong> Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR).</span></li><li><strong>Collection of access data and log files: </strong>Access to our online offering is logged in the form of so-called "server log files". Server log files may include the address and name of the retrieved web pages and files, date and time of retrieval, transferred data volumes, notification of successful retrieval, browser type and version, the user's operating system, referrer URL (the previously visited page), and, as a rule, IP addresses and the requesting provider. The server log files can be used for security purposes, e.g., to avoid overloading the servers (especially in the case of abusive attacks, so-called DDoS attacks), and to ensure the utilization and stability of the servers; <span class=""><strong>Legal bases:</strong> Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR). </span><strong>Deletion of data:</strong> Log file information is stored for a maximum of 30 days and then deleted or anonymized. Data whose further retention is required for evidentiary purposes is excluded from deletion until the respective incident has been finally clarified.</li></ul>
            <h2 id="m134">Use of Cookies</h2><p>The term "cookies" refers to functions that store information on users' end devices and read it from them. Cookies can also be used for various purposes, such as for the functionality, security, and comfort of online offerings, as well as for creating analyses of visitor flows. We use cookies in accordance with legal regulations. For this, we obtain the user's consent in advance where necessary. If consent is not required, we rely on our legitimate interests. This applies when the storage and reading of information is essential to provide expressly requested content and functions.

This can include, for example, graphics, videos, or city maps (hereinafter uniformly referred to as "content").</p>
            <p>The integration always requires that the third-party providers of this content process the user's IP address, as they could not send the content to their browser without the IP address. The IP address is therefore necessary for the display of this content or functions. We strive to use only such content whose respective providers use the IP address solely for the delivery of the content. Third-party providers may also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as "web beacons") for statistical or marketing purposes. The "pixel tags" can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous information can also be stored in cookies on the user's device and may contain, among other things, technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, visit time, and other information about the use of our online offering, but may also be linked to such information from other sources.</p>

The IP address of the user is communicated to the font provider so that the fonts can be made available in the user's browser. In addition, technical data (language settings, screen resolution, operating system, hardware used) are transmitted, which are necessary for the provision of the fonts depending on the devices used and the technical environment. This data may be processed on a server of the font provider in the USA - When visiting our online offering, users' browsers send their browser HTTP requests to the Google Fonts Web API (i.e., a software interface for retrieving the fonts). The Google Fonts Web API provides users with the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) of Google Fonts and then the fonts specified in the CSS. These HTTP requests include (1) the IP address used by the respective user to access the internet, (2) the requested URL on the Google server, and (3) the HTTP headers, including the user agent, which describes the browser and operating system versions of the website visitors, and the referrer URL (i.e., the web page on which the Google font is to be displayed). IP addresses are neither logged nor stored on Google servers and are not analyzed. The Google Fonts Web API logs details of the HTTP requests (requested URL, user agent, and referrer URL). Access to this data is restricted and strictly controlled. The requested URL identifies the font families for which the user wants to load fonts. This data is logged so that Google can determine how often a particular font family is requested. With the Google Fonts Web API, the user agent must adapt the font that is generated for the respective browser type. The user agent is primarily logged for debugging purposes and used to generate aggregated usage statistics that measure the popularity of font families. These aggregated usage statistics are published on the "Analytics" page of Google Fonts. Finally, the referrer URL is logged so that the data can be used for production maintenance and an aggregated report on the top integrations can be generated based on the number of font requests. According to its own information, Google does not use any of the information collected by Google Fonts to create profiles of end users or to display targeted ads; <strong>Service provider:</strong> Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland; <span class=""><strong>Legal bases:</strong> Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR); </span><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank">https://fonts.google.com/</a>; <strong>Privacy policy:</strong> <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>; <strong>Basis for third-country transfers:</strong> Data Privacy Framework (DPF). <strong>Further information:</strong> <a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq/privacy?hl=en" target="_blank">https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq/privacy?hl=en</a>.</li></ul>

            <p>Legal bases (Austria): Insofar as we process data to fulfill our legal obligations under the Whistleblower Protection Act (HSchG), the legal basis for processing is Article 6(1)(c) GDPR and, in the case of special categories of personal data, Art. 9(2)(g) GDPR, each in conjunction with § 8 HSchG. This relates to the obligation to establish and operate an internal whistleblower reporting office, the fulfillment of its legal duties, and, in the case of using the data collected in the reporting procedure, taking further investigative or labor law measures against persons convicted of a violation.</p>
            <p>Insofar as we process data (especially in cases of identified misconduct) in the context of or in preparation for legal defense, this is done on the basis of our legitimate interests in legally compliant and ethical conduct in accordance with Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.</p>
            <p>If you have given us consent to process personal data for specific purposes, the processing is based on this consent pursuant to Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and, in the case of special categories<span class="dsg-license-content-blurred de dsg-ttip-activate" title="Please purchase a license to unlock the text."> - This text area must be unlocked with a premium license. -                                           </span></p>
            <p>Types of data processed: </p>
            <p>In the course of receiving and processing tips, as well as in the subsequent whistleblower procedure, we may collect various data.

            </li></ul><p>Special categories of personal data: </p>
            <p>It may happen that we collect special types of personal data in the course of our activities, especially if they are communicated by a whistleblower. These include:</p><ul> <li>Health-related data of a person,</li><li>Data on the racial or ethnic origin of persons,</li><li>Information about a person's religious or philosophical beliefs,</li><li>Information about a person's sexual orientation.</li> </ul><p>This data is only processed if it<span class="dsg-license-content-blurred de dsg-ttip-activate" title="Please purchase a license to unlock the text."> - This text area must be unlocked with a premium license. -                </span></p>
            <p>Use of our online forms: Please note that it is possible to submit tips anonymously.

            <p>Providing names: You have the option to submit tips anonymously. However, unless prohibited by national legislation, we recommend providing your name and contact details. This allows us to investigate the report more effectively and, if necessary, contact you directly.</p>
            <p>If you provide your name and contact details, your identity will be treated with strict confidentiality. Exceptions to this confidentiality only exist if we are legally obliged to disclose your identity. This may be necessary to protect our rights or the rights of our employees, customers, suppliers, or business partners<span class="dsg-license-content-blurred de dsg-ttip-activate" title="Please purchase a license to unlock the text."> - This text area must be unlocked with a premium license. -                       </span></p>
            <p>Provision of data to third parties: Data related to the submitted tips will only be passed on to third parties under certain circumstances. This happens either a) if you have given us your express consent, or b) if there is a legal obligation to disclose the data. Possible third parties include public authorities, government, regulatory, or tax authorities, if the disclosure is necessary to fulfill a legal or regulatory obligation. In addition, we may engage lawyers and other professional advisors in accordance with legal provisions. They are authorized to investigate suspected misconduct and take necessary measures after an investigation, such as initiating disciplinary or legal proceedings. Furthermore, carefully selected and monitored service providers may receive data for these purposes (e.g., operators of a web-based reporting system). However, these service providers are contractually obliged to comply with the applicable data protection regulations as part of a data processing agreement.</p>
            <p>Data retention and deletion: Personal data is only processed for as long as is necessary to fulfill the processing purposes described above. If this data is no longer necessary for the stated purposes, it will be deleted. In certain situations, however, the data may be retained for longer to meet legal requirements, as long as this is necessary and proportionate. In such cases<span class="dsg-license-content-blurred de dsg-ttip-activate" title="Please purchase a license to unlock the text."> - This text area must be unlocked with a premium license. -                </span></p>

            <h2 id="m42">Definitions of Terms</h2><p>This section provides an overview of the terms used in this privacy policy. Insofar as the terms are legally defined, their legal definitions apply. The following explanations, on the other hand, are primarily intended to aid understanding.</p>
             <ul class="glossary"><li><strong>Employees:</strong> Employees are persons who are in an employment relationship, whether as staff, employees, or in similar positions. An employment relationship is a legal relationship between an employer and an employee, which is established by an employment contract or agreement. It includes the employer's obligation to pay the employee remuneration, while the employee provides their labor. The employment relationship includes various phases, including the establishment, in which the employment contract is concluded, the performance, in which the employee carries out their work, and the termination, when the employment relationship ends, whether by dismissal, termination agreement, or otherwise. Employee data is all information that relates to these persons and is in the context of their employment. This includes aspects such as personal identification data, identification numbers, salary and bank data, working hours, vacation entitlements, health data, and performance appraisals. </li><li><strong>Inventory data:</strong> Inventory data includes essential information necessary for the identification and management of contractual partners, user accounts, profiles, and similar assignments. This data may include, among other things, personal and demographic information such as names, contact information (addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses), birth dates, and specific identifiers (user IDs). Inventory data forms the basis for any formal interaction between individuals and services, institutions, or systems by enabling unique assignment and communication. </li><li><strong>Content data:</strong> Content data includes information generated in the course of creating, editing, and publishing content of all kinds. This category of data can include texts, images, videos, audio files, and other multimedia content published on various platforms and media. Content data is not limited to the actual content but also includes metadata that provides information about the content itself, such as tags, descriptions, author information, and publication dates. </li><li><strong>Contact data:</strong> Contact data is essential information that enables communication with individuals or organizations. It includes, among other things, telephone numbers, postal addresses, and email addresses, as well as communication means such as social media handles and instant messaging identifiers. </li><li><strong>Meta, communication, and procedural data:</strong> Meta, communication, and procedural data are categories that contain information about the way data is processed, transmitted, and managed. Metadata, also known as data about data, includes information that describes the context, origin, and structure of other data. It can include information on file size, creation date, the author of a document, and change histories. Communication data captures the exchange of information between users via various channels, such as email traffic, call logs, messages on social networks, and chat histories, including the involved persons, timestamps, and transmission paths. Procedural data describes the processes and workflows within systems or organizations, including workflow documentation, logs of transactions and activities, and audit logs used for tracking and reviewing operations. </li><li><strong>Usage data:</strong> Usage data refers to information that captures how users interact with digital products, services, or platforms. This data includes a wide range of information that shows how users use applications, which functions they prefer, how long they stay on certain pages, and through which paths they navigate through an application. Usage data can also include the frequency of use, timestamps of activities, IP addresses, device information, and location data. It is particularly valuable for analyzing user behavior, optimizing user experiences, personalizing content, and improving products or services. In addition, usage data plays a crucial role in identifying trends, preferences, and potential problem areas within digital offerings. </li><li><strong>Personal data:</strong> "Personal data" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (hereinafter "data subject"); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier (e.g., cookie) or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. </li><li><strong>Log data:</strong> Log data is information about events or activities that have been logged in a system or network. This data typically includes information such as timestamps, IP addresses, user actions, error messages, and other details about the use or operation of a system. Log data is often used to analyze system problems, for security monitoring, or to create performance reports. </li><li><strong>Controller:</strong> "Controller" means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data. </li><li><strong>Processing:</strong> "Processing" means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means. The term is broad and covers virtually any handling of data, be it collecting, evaluating, storing, transmitting, or deleting. </li></ul><p class="seal"><a href="https://datenschutz-generator.de/" title="Legal text by Dr. Schwenke - click for more information." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Created with the free Privacy Policy Generator by Dr. Thomas Schwenke</a></p>
